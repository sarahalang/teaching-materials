# Teaching Materials
A repository where teaching materials are hosted. 
They can be cheatsheets (visual pdf summaries using lots of boxes which are meant to be printed out and used as memory-friendly references), slides that go with those cheatsheets and even some minimal XSLT stylesheets I use for teaching. Or Python or R code. It really depends on what I'll find in my teaching materials folder. 
I will try to progressively find materials I have created so far (this relocation process might turn out a relatively complex endeavour) and I will check if they are more of less fit for publication on this github. However, only because some materials have been published, this certainly doesn't mean they are free from mistakes (not even free from typos!). So while you are encouraged to reuse them if you want, please reuse them mindfully. If you find mistakes or decide to reuse the materials in your class, I would be happy if you could let me know. 

## Important Stuff To Note (in case you didn't read the text above)
* They are free to reuse. 
* Not all of them have had many rounds of error checking, so in case you find errors, please let me know and I'll correct them.
* Looking forward to hearing from you!


## Some of them have their own repos (including the LaTeX source!)

## Preparatory workshop to an Intro to CLTK workshop
My original workshop was called 'Digitale Sprachverarbeitung für historische Disziplinen' and was held at Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz in November 2019.
